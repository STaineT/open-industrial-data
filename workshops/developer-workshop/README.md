# Accessing the CDP 

This will provide analysts, solution architects, data scientists and anyone else interested in the CDP an introduction to
how to access data through the Python SDK.

Documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://cognite-sdk-python.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/cognite.html#api).
