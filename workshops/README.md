# Using Google Collab

All of the notebooks created for workshops and hackathons have been developed using Google Collab. Google Collab can be thought of as a Jupyter notebook in the cloud.

Google Collab comes pre-installed with many necessary packages or it allows others such as the `cognite-sdk`
package to be installed on the cloud instance.

It also solves the issue of people having different python environments installed on their local machine, and works on both Mac and Windows.

The notebooks can also be exported to GitHub for convenience.
